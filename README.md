# Frogger-Game
Classic Frogger game using javascript and typescript

---------------------------------------------------------------
# Structure
Created 4 main Classes:
### Map ###
The map works as a 2D array of the class Tile. This class is the main structure of the map and is where the Player moves around. The map is the base to understand if the player can move between tiles

### Tile ###
The tile is the representation of a slot in the map matrix, returns position or TilePosition ( x: 5, y: 1 )

### Player ###
The player is a simple Phaser.Sprite class that moves around on the Tiles of Map class, can move in X and Y axis

### Enemy ###


---------------------------------------------------------------
# Development
Started by developing the Map, Player and Tile class and created a relation between them, where the map contains the structure of Tiles where the Frog ( Player ) will be able to move around or predict enemies, platforms or walls.
